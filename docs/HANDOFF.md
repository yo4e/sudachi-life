# SUDACHI Project Handoff

Last updated: July 22, 2026

## Cold-start summary

SUDACHI asks whether a bounded artificial organism can convert external cognitive scaffolding into verified local competence and retain capability while becoming less dependent on that scaffolding.

A future caregiver may be human, deterministic, model-based, hybrid, or absent. Phase 1 has no caregiver.

One SQLite database is the canonical runtime body. Git and repository documents record source, protected tests, decisions, and developmental history.

## Normative authority

For Phase 1, use this precedence:

1. Minimal Organism Contract v0.2
2. accepted ADRs 0001–0006
3. protected tests and `docs/PHASE1_TEST_MATRIX.md`
4. this handoff
5. explanatory architecture and roadmap documents

When sources conflict, stop and repair the contract, test, or documentation. Do not choose private semantics in code.

## Current state

Phase 0 is complete. Issue #1 is closed. Issue #13 tracks Phase 1 implementation.

### Slice 1 — foundation and genesis

Merged through PR #14: package, canonical SQLite body, injected clocks, protected garden and budgets, append-only events, verified genesis checkpoint, `init`, and `status`.

### Slice 2 — inbox, wake ownership, and observation

Merged through PR #15: idempotent garden ticks, fail-fast `BEGIN IMMEDIATE`, non-queued competing-wake rejection, oldest input claim, and deterministic full observation.

### Slice 3 — first canonical water wake

Merged through PR #17:

- fixed `water_plot(bed-a)` decision
- action and mutation reservation before change
- savepoint execution and independent evaluation
- exact pending boundary at event sequence 13
- lifecycle checkpoint stabilization at sequence 14
- return to `sleeping`
- checkpoint timeout preserves committed pending state

### Slice 4 — canonical harvest wake

Merged through PR #18:

- the fixed policy reuses the same lifecycle and selects `harvest_plot(bed-b)` when no water target remains
- the executor removes exactly one fruit and increments harvested inventory inside a savepoint
- the evaluator independently proves the transition and changes objective completion from false to true
- the second pending boundary is event sequence 24
- administrative checkpoint stabilization is event sequence 25
- the protected objective becomes complete and the organism sleeps at lifecycle 2

### Slice 5 — objective-complete abstention

Merged through PR #19:

- the third canonical tick observes `objective_complete = true`
- a dedicated abstention decision records `objective_already_complete`
- zero action attempts and zero environment mutations are consumed
- the evaluator independently proves that plots, inventory, objective, and environment step remain unchanged
- lifecycle 3 commits pending boundary 34 and stabilizes at event sequence 35
- the organism returns to `sleeping` with failure streak zero
- the complete canonical water, harvest, abstention run is protected

### Slice 6 — classified no-applicable-action abstention

Merged through PR #20:

- a protected administrative fixture creates an incomplete objective with a dry sprout, no water, and no harvestable fruit
- the fixed policy selects typed `no_applicable_action` before entering any mutating executor
- one input and one observation are consumed; action attempts and environment mutations remain zero
- the independent evaluator proves that the objective remains incomplete, no protected action is executable, unresolved needs remain unchanged, and canonical environment state does not move
- `consecutive_failures` advances exactly once from zero to one
- the protected maintenance threshold remains three and is not entered
- the committed pending boundary is event sequence 16 and administrative stabilization is event sequence 17
- the organism returns to `sleeping`

The fixture is test administration, not a live caregiver. No human, model, or fixture caregiver participates in action selection.

### Slice 7 — resource-aware harvest recovery

Implemented and verified in PR #21:

- a protected administrative fixture starts with an incomplete objective, a dry sprout, zero water, one harvestable fruit, and `consecutive_failures = 1`
- deterministic observation exposes no executable water target and one executable harvest target
- the fixed policy skips impossible watering and selects `harvest_plot(bed-b)`
- one input, observation, action attempt, and environment mutation are consumed; all external-capability counters remain zero
- the independent evaluator proves the exact harvest transition, positive progress, and an objective that correctly remains incomplete
- unresolved needs decrease from two to one
- `consecutive_failures` resets exactly once from one to zero
- the committed pending boundary is event sequence 17 and administrative stabilization is event sequence 18
- the organism returns to `sleeping`

The recovery fixture is also test administration and does not participate in action selection.

## Verified implementation results

GitHub Actions passed on PR #21 with Python 3.12:

- clean editable installation
- `python -m compileall -q src tests`
- **31 protected tests**
- installed genesis CLI smoke test
- all earlier canonical water, harvest, and completion-abstention behavior remains protected
- the blocked-state fixture completes typed abstention, one failure increment, checkpoint stabilization, and sleep
- the recovery fixture skips impossible watering, harvests, resets the failure streak, checkpoints, and sleeps

The source-tree local run also passed **30 tests** and compileall. A separate local clean editable install could not resolve the `hatchling` build dependency from the execution environment's package mirror; GitHub Actions independently completed the clean install, so the repository result is verified without treating the local mirror failure as success.

Canonical three-wake values remain:

- `lifecycle_number = 3`
- `environment_step = 2`
- `bed-a.moisture = 1`
- `bed-b.fruit = 0`
- `water_units = 0`
- `harvested_fruit = 1`
- `objective_complete = true`
- `latest_stable_event_sequence = 34`
- `event_count = 35`
- `status = sleeping`

The isolated Slice 6 blocked fixture finishes with:

- `lifecycle_number = 1`
- `environment_step = 0`
- `bed-a.moisture = 0`
- `bed-b.fruit = 0`
- `water_units = 0`
- `harvested_fruit = 0`
- `objective_complete = false`
- `consecutive_failures = 1`
- `latest_stable_event_sequence = 16`
- `event_count = 17`
- `status = sleeping`

The isolated Slice 7 recovery fixture finishes with:

- `lifecycle_number = 1`
- `environment_step = 1`
- `bed-a.moisture = 0`
- `bed-b.fruit = 0`
- `water_units = 0`
- `harvested_fruit = 1`
- `objective_complete = false`
- `consecutive_failures = 0`
- `latest_stable_event_sequence = 17`
- `event_count = 18`
- `status = sleeping`

## Integration repair record

PR #15 was accidentally merged before its required foundation in PR #14. PR #16 repaired the order, introduced clean-checkout CI, and verified the combined baseline. This was an integration defect, not a contract change.

## Accepted Phase 1 baseline

- one canonical SQLite database per organism
- event sequence, not timestamp, defines canonical order
- injected wall and monotonic time
- fail-fast SQLite write ownership
- one input, observation, action attempt, and successful mutation at most per mutating wake
- zero caregiver, network, subprocess, and authoritative external-write capability
- no scalar energy
- immutable checkpoint after every committed wake before another wake
- rollback will preserve the abandoned future and create a new lineage generation

## Exact next implementation task

After PR #21 is merged, create a new branch from current `main` and implement **Slice 8: classified action failure and savepoint cost preservation**.

The slice must:

1. use an explicit protected failure-injection fixture with one executable registered action
2. reserve and charge the action attempt before execution
3. begin the transition inside the existing SQLite savepoint
4. inject a classified failure after at least one partial environment write
5. prove the savepoint removes every partial environment change
6. commit a failure outcome without recording false action success
7. preserve the charged action-attempt cost while recording zero successful environment mutations
8. increment `consecutive_failures` exactly once below the maintenance threshold
9. commit and stabilize an exact checkpoint boundary
10. return to sleep and prove the result in protected tests and CI

Do not add budget exhaustion, maintenance-threshold entry, lineage rollback, caregiver consultation, learning, or generic planning in Slice 8.

## Current issue map

- **Issue #1 — closed:** Phase 0 contract freeze.
- **Issue #2 — closed:** Copilot architecture review.
- **Issue #3 — open:** caregiver withdrawal, prior work, novelty, human-caregiver, and provider research.
- **Issue #13 — open:** Phase 1 metabolism implementation.

Always verify current GitHub state.

## Do not add during Phase 1

- a human or model caregiver
- chat or natural-language action selection
- network or subprocess access
- organism-writable external files
- arbitrary code or shell execution
- continuous operation
- learning, memories, skills, consolidation, or fading
- scalar energy, mood, affection, or personality
- a generic agent framework

## End-of-session protocol

Before ending substantial work:

1. run relevant protected tests in CI and report exact results
2. update contract or ADRs before implementing changed invariants
3. update the test matrix, issue, and pull-request status
4. update this file with true state, failures, and one exact next action
5. leave no required decision only in chat or model memory

**As it becomes smarter, it should become smaller and quieter.**
