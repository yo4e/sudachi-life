# AGENTS.md

This file is the continuity contract for AI collaborators working on SUDACHI.

## Cold-start rule

Assume you remember nothing about SUDACHI. Reconstruct the project from repository and current GitHub state before proposing or changing anything. Repository and GitHub state outrank conversation history.

3. `docs/AI_COLLABORATION_OPERATIONS.md`
4. `docs/ORIGIN.md`

## Core question

SUDACHI asks whether a bounded artificial organism can convert finite external cognitive scaffolding into verified local competence and retain capability while requiring less justified caregiver assistance.

```text
parent reasoning -> verified experience -> reusable skill -> cheap local behavior
```

The repository is the organism's auditable body, developmental history, skill base, and lineage record. A model may later be caregiver or organ; it is not the organism.

> As it becomes smarter, it should become smaller and quieter.

Do not flatten SUDACHI into a generic agent, chatbot, virtual pet, or self-modifying loop.

## Frozen Phase 1

Normative precedence:

1. Minimal Organism Contract v0.2
2. accepted ADRs 0001–0007
3. protected Phase 1 tests and `docs/PHASE1_TEST_MATRIX.md`

Phase 1 passed final independent audit at `62c9e0c6ba7e33eee85e1687b8bf6a3978a25338`. All 152 protected tests remain unchanged and form the schema-v1 control.

Phase 2 must not reinterpret or change Phase 1 garden actions, selector, executor, evaluators, clocks, checkpoint rules, rollback transformation, writer categories, or protected tests.

PR #73 temporarily reopened shared code only for explicitly authorized physical-limit defects and merged as `c9004027a94b709802af7f590d46de862dd93d7d`. Those physical boundaries are re-frozen. Pre-repair bodies remain in explicit `*_impl.py` modules.

The pre-request-extension garden wake remains byte-identical in `lifecycle_impl.py`, blob `c971d77cc9beab22f5c50fb692b4f81210cbf3ed`.

## Accepted Phase 2 boundary

ADRs 0008, 0009, and 0010, Consultation Protocol v1, the ADR 0010 matrix amendment, and the Phase 2 matrix form one accepted design package. Issue #61 owns implementation.

Canonical writer categories remain exactly `organism` and `administration`. Caregiver and adapter identities are untrusted provenance only.

Original Phase 1 budget locations remain exactly `phase1-v1`. Phase 2 policy lives only in immutable `consultation_configuration`.

Operational boundaries remain explicit:

1. Garden request wake preserves the frozen Phase 1 outcome and uses only an optional storage-safe request extension.
2. Administrative dispatch commits and charges before fixture execution and releases SQLite ownership first.
3. The deterministic fixture receives only the final request envelope and declared case, with no runtime authority handles.
4. Administrative ingress or terminalization validates exact typed bytes and never automatically retries fixture work.
5. Explicit disposition considers at most one proposal, checkpoints, and does not execute an action or create memory/skills.

Proposal types: `action_candidate`, `abstain`, `defer`.

Dispositions: `accepted`, `rejected`, `deferred`, `clarification_requested`.

Clarification rounds: zero.

## Accepted limits

- request envelope: 16 KiB
- complete external package: 16 KiB
- provenance: 8 KiB within package
- four requests and four charged fixture invocations per current lineage
- one outstanding current-lineage request
- 64 KiB logical consultation payload per lineage
- zero human/model/money/declared fixture latency
- active database and individual database artifact: 8 MiB
- checkpoint store: 40 MiB
- runtime working set: 64 MiB
- next-wake reserve: 1 MiB

## Implemented state

### Slice 36 — complete

PRs #65, #66, #67, #69, #70, #71, #72, and #73 implement schema-v2 genesis, zero-caregiver projection, checkpoint repair, retention, rollback, event export, paired overhead, and absolute physical limits.

Final Slice 36 run 512: `230 passed in 32.41s` plus install, compile, and schema-v1 CLI smoke.

### Slice 37 — request boundary

- PR #81 merged as `268fc5a8571f50cf19d7c8db15f975b40b1cd05c`; run 520: `236 passed in 33.52s`.
- PR #83 merged as `208956c40bffc0eff94307e6d326a071ee386d94`; run 533: `242 passed in 31.65s`.
- PR #85 merged as `82e17c6ccba65323315b399ea6fad345a52db5f4`; run 538: 245 tests passed.

### Slice 38a — canonical digest and request schema

PR #87 merged as `16af01a84aae3d802a112228c85ec4b1849c19ee`. Code/test run 545: `261 passed in 34.10s`.

It closes P2-H01, H02 core, H03, and request-side D11. Shared `phase2_protocol.py` owns canonical bytes, exact digest labels, request identity/ID, and final request validation.

The prior request constructor remains byte-identical in `phase2_request_impl.py`, blob `46881e023d990f5c7ce393cac7060958419383c0`.

### Slice 38b — proposal schema

PR #91 merged as `068b3d30b91bd0bec89344a0d27b4685b3764a65`. Implementation run 551: `275 passed in 29.84s`; final run 552 passed all steps.

It closes P2-H05/H06, P2-I02–I09, and proposal-side I11.

## ADR 0010 clarification boundary

The project owner formally accepted the resolutions of Issues #88, #89, #92, and #93.

ADR 0010 fixes exact dispatch identity, external provenance, response/package cardinality, current-state projection, disposition identity, and the absence of optional request context in Protocol v1.

Do not add an undeclared request field, provenance field, adapter/case, current-state field, or authority route. Any future addition requires a later protocol version or ADR.

## Exact restart point

1. Merge the Slice 38b closeout/ADR 0010 documentation PR.
2. Close Issues #88, #89, #92, and #93 as completed.
3. Implement Slice 38c dispatch identity, response/provenance, proposal-response graph, and package validators.
4. Implement P2-E10 using the largest structural closed-v1 request; do not add context or filler.
5. Then implement Slice 39 administrative dispatch/precharge/fixture boundary.
6. Keep all 152 Phase 1 tests unchanged and passing.
7. Do not use Codex until the complete Phase 2 implementation candidate is CI-green and ready for the single completion audit.

## End-of-work protocol

- update `docs/HANDOFF.md`
- update matrices and durable notes
- update relevant Issues and PRs
- report tests, CI, failures, and skipped checks honestly
- keep no critical decision only in chat
- preserve repository language policy

Repository prose, code, Issues, ADRs, and tests are English. Intentional Japanese README lines remain the standing exception.
